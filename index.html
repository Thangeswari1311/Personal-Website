        <p >My hobby is reading books. I started reading books from my school library and still continue reading.  My favourite author is Jane Austen and my favourite book is Pride and Pre Judice. I am glad that I cultivated the habit of reading and will always have a friend to accompany. I enjoy both fiction and non fiction. Robin Sharma's books have thaught me a lot about planning and being organized.</p>
